          "content": "In England, housing design strongly reflects a focus on personal privacy and individual expression. This is evident in features such as en-suite bathrooms, individual bedrooms for each resident, and functional additions like utility rooms, garden sheds, and guest toilets. The home is viewed as a private retreat, with front gardens left open and visible, while the main garden at the back offers seclusion for residents. In contrast, Japanese homes emphasize family privacy and shared living, often featuring large, multi-purpose areas that combine kitchen, dining, and living spaces to promote warmth and togetherness. Gardens are designed for calm and atmosphere rather than activity, and houses are typically enclosed by fences to protect family privacy. Although the cultural focus remains on familial closeness, personal privacy has become more important in recent decades, as reflected in the growing adoption of Western-style bedrooms—from just 17% in the 1970s to 66% by the 1990s.",

Quantitative analysis was based on the examination of house floor plans and furnishings, with a sample size of 146 in England and 123 in Japan. Statistical techniques such as T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used to analyze the data. On the qualitative side, structured interviews were conducted with 56 homeowners in England and 55 in Japan. These interviews included four key open-ended questions, addressing topics such as the ideal home and individual preferences or dislikes. The responses were systematically coded into 20 thematic categories, including privacy, space, family, and aesthetics.",

Cultural attitudes toward privacy differ notably between England and Japan. In England, where individualism is strongly valued, there is a high emphasis on personal privacy, which is understood as having one’s own self-contained space. In contrast, Japan’s collectivistic culture, shaped by Confucian values, places greater importance on shared spaces and familial privacy. Here, privacy is defined less by individual separation and more by the intimacy and closeness within the family environment.

The core tenets of Mindscape Theory include intracultural heterogeneity, transcultural heterogeneity and dominance of certain types. Mindscape Theory is proposed as a critique of the common assumption of intracultural homogeneity prevalent in many cross-cultural studies, particularly those following the framework of Hofstede, which explains how cultural values differ between countries by identifying six dimensions, such as individualism vs. collectivism and power distance. In high power distance cultures, \npeople tend to accept authority and hierarchy, so leaders are expected to make decisions without much input. In individualistic cultures, people value independence and personal achievement, \nwhile collectivist cultures emphasize group harmony and loyalty. The connection between mindscape theory and beauty is that aesthetic preferences are used as a way to capture and understand the different mindscape types within and between cultures.",

Many traditional cross cultural studies wrongly assume that members of a culture are largely homogeneous in their thinking and logic. This study provides empirical evidence for the existence of significant individual differences within cultures (intracultural heterogeneity). Additionally, the \"ugly\" to \"beautiful\" rating scale might be interpreted differently across cultures. The findings support ¹Maruyama's Mindscape Theory, which posits that individual differences in thinking and logic exist \nboth within and between cultures.",
